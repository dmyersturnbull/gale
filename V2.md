# Gale

Gale is a domain-specific language to **build and compute arbitrarily sized vectors and matrices** in one line.

It seamlessly applies operations to scalars, vectors, and matrices and sports functions for linear algebra, statistics, random distributions, combinatorics, and signal processing. You can use it to define features to calculate on a video stream, build random vectors or matrices, or schedule events.

It was designed for users with some math but little or no programming knowledge. There are no loops, variables, or scope. It's purely functional and uses type inference.
Here are some 1-line programs. Note the use of `i`,`j`, and `$`:
- `i + j` ← a matrix of arbitrary size
- `$${-1} + rand.norm(1,1)` ← Brownian motion (submartingale)
- `mean($${-1..-3}) + rand.norm(1,1)` ← same, but average the last 3 (or max available)
- `if(i<=j -> comb.stirling2(i, j))` ← upper-triangular matrix of Stirling numbers of the 2nd kind
- `$a := matrix[m,n];  count(abs($a-$a{-1}) >= 2)` ← count matrix elements that changed by >±1.
- `$a := matrix[m,n];  morph.erosion($a-$a{-1}, shape.circle(2))` ← morphological erosion by an ellipse of radius 2

The last two examples require a series of input (m×n) matrices called _a_: plain `a` is the _current_ input while `a{-1}` is the previous one. The parser knows from the definition that it should _slide_ over a series of `a`, regardless of the dimensions. It also knows from the _-1_ to keep only two elements in memory at a time (if the data is streamed).
You could instead have it slide over two axes (i _and_ j) by substituting `a{-1}` with `b{-1,-1}`. Imaging a two-dimensional grid (i by j), where each has an input matrix `$a` (with subscripts i,j) and an output matrix `$$` (with subscripts i,j).

Here is a more involved example that does not slide over indices.
Instead, it takes two input matrices, crops out an arc, and 

```
# take two n×n matrices as input
# the dimensions are guaranteed to be divisible by 4
$a       := matrix[4n,4n]
$b       := matrix[4n,4n]
# make an arc in 1/4 of the image
$arc     := shape.circle(n.rows($a)/4)
# put the arc at the bottom-left and only that piece
# the result of image.crop will be a matrix of 1/4 the size
$a'      := image.crop($a, shape.realize($arc, 0, 0))`
$b'      := image.crop($b, shape.realize($arc, 0, 0))`
# this is allowed because the dimensions are known to match:
$sum     := multiply($a', $b')
```

Crazy idea I just thought of. I don't know how to implement this except by multi-stage evaluation, which would affect type consistency. But this would be awesome:
```
$a    := matrix[n,n]
generate(i+j) + $a
```

"Sub-sliding."
Instead of streaming over i and j for the whole expression, it streams only for `i+j`, then adds to `$a`.
In fact, the `generate` function could be always required.
An even crazier thing would be:

```
$a    := matrix[n,n]
generate(i,j) + $a + j
```

Would this be a parse error?

## formal defs

Formally, it's a parsing expression grammar (PEG).
Rules are pretty simple: operators map two inputs to the same type, i, j, and k are tensor indices, and curly braces reference previous elements, with `..` for a range. The `if` function works with the `->` symbol like this: `if(condition1 -> value1, condition2 -> value2, ..., elsevalue)`. If no condition matches (no `elsevalue`), the default value (normally 0) is returned. Indexing (with `$` and `{}`) is probably the only tricky syntax.  A syntax glossary is in the next section.

This package contains the grammars, a parser in Scala, a command-line tool, and a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).
The dimensions, data type, and default values (for sparse matrices) are passed as arguments alongside the expression. Examples using the CLI:
```
>>> gale "sin(i)" 0..10 --dtype float --default neginf --round 2
-∞ 0.84 0.91 0.14 -0.76 -0.96 -0.28 0.66 0.99 0.41

>>> gale "i" 0..10 --round 2 format hex8
00000000000000003FF000000000000040000000

>>> gale " i"    0..1000 --format raw >  file1.bytes
>>> gale "-i" 1000..2000 --format raw >> file1.bytes
```

##### Syntax glossary

The grammar is whitespace- and case-insensitive.
Ten syntax elements are defined: (1) scalar (or string) literals, (2) operators, (3) functions, (4) parentheses for grouping, (5) the current indices (i, j, k), (6) the conditional symbol `->` for if statements, (7) comparison operators (`=`, `<`, `<=`, etc), (8) references (curly braces), (9) references with `$`, and (10) declarations with `:=`.

Input data types:
- `int`
- `float`
- `matrix[m,n]`
- `vector[n]`

You can say `int>0` for a positive integer, `int!=0` for a nonzero, etc.

`int.even` is an even integer, and `int.even>1` is a positive even integer.
Possibly something like `int|3` will be allowed for divisibility, but it may not be useful enough.

You can add coefficients, ex: `matrix[2n,2n]` is an even-dimensional square matrix.
You can also use scalars, like: `matrix[3,2]`.
And you can use `>`,`>`, `<=`, and `>=` as expected: `vector[n>1]`. `matrix[4n>2]` means literally that 4*n is greater than 2. Currently, this doesn't affect anything.
And you can suffix like this: `matrix.invertible[m,n]`.
And finally `$matrix[m,n]>=0` is matrix with nonnegative values.

To avoid having to choose different letters for each input, you cannot reference dimensions. You need to use the relevant functions like `n.rows`.

Statements must always be ordered:
1. setting of reserved values
2. defining input types
3. operations / core code

The last statement determines the value, including if it's a declaration. So if the last line is `ans := 5+5` or just `5+5` that will end it. Not using an input in the computation will result in a parse/compile-time error.


Data types:
- boolean, signed byte, signed int, signed long, signed float, signed double
- row vector
- column vector
- matrix of fixed dimensions
- matrix of free dimensions (which has limited allowed operations)
- slice/slide (positive integer indicating a vector length)
- shape/cutout (arbitrary dimensions)
- reference to index (nonnegative int)
- conditional expression (that evaluates to a fixed type)

Technically, matrix types are expanded into an infinite set of types corresponding to the intersection of these properties:
- dtype (double etc)
- has known dimensions / has free dimensions
- the dimensions that are known
- known to be square / or not
- numbers the dimensions are divisible by
- known to be invertible / not invertible
- known to be nonnegative / positive / nonpositive / negative

Matrices and vectors are typed according to their dimensions.
For example, `multiply($m, transpose($n))` will return a type of `matrix[n.rows, m.columns]`.
Multiplying `multiply($m, $m)` is a parse error unless `$m` is typed as a square matrix.
Multiplying `$m` will always be a parse error unless it's typed accordingly.

Variables must match the regex: `\$[a-z0-9][a-z0-9.]+'?`.
Reserved names start with `$.` instead, and these should not be referenced. The jury's still out as to whether referencing them is allowed at all.

Reserved names with default values:
Except data type, these can be set to a variable that will be passed in, like `$.seed := $.seed`.
There are aliases such that `$.seed.system` could be just `system`.

- Data type: `$.dtype := $.dtype.double` (can be `double`, `float`, `int`, `long`, or `byte`). Cannot be set by substition.
- Rounding: `$.round := $.rounding.none`
- Step (only evaluate some number of iterations): `$.step := 1`
- Offset (start evaluating at): `$.offset := 0`
- Random seed: `$.seed := $.seed.system` (can be an integer or `"$.seed.system"`)
- Tolerance assumed per operation, for approximate equality: `$.epsilon := $.epsilon.machine`
- Default value when no _if_ condition matches: `$.default := 0`
- Out-of-bounds access value: `$.oob := NaN`

About tolerance (epsilon):
Gale does some numerical analysis to determine the maximum error that could have accumulated for the comparison operators: the number of operations that could introduce error multiplied by the machine epsilon (maximum error for an operation). For example, the tolerance will be `10E−15 * 10` for 64-bit floats after ten operations on the right-hand side (or left-hand side), and `2 * 10E−15 * 10` if 10 operations were performed on both sides.
Of course, this does not take error in the input into account, which would be cause to override this value.

If the dimensions of an operation aren't guaranteed to match, you can explicitly call round, floor, or ceil.
Ex: `image.crop($a, round($a/4))`

The shape functions return cutout objects, which are dimensionless but contain shapes (closed loops) of fixed dimensions.
For example, in `morph.erosion($m, shape.circle(5))`, `$m` might only be 3×3, but the operation will proceed.
These have a few operators of their own:
- `|` for union
- `&` for intersection
- `-` for difference
- `~` for complement
- `*-` for symmetric difference

There's currently an ambiguity in cropping by a complement shape.

`shape.realize` turns a shape into a matrix.
Then you can do `image.crop($m, shape.realize(shape.circle(5), 0.0, 0.0))` to cut out (and keep) an arc.
Or `image.crop($m, shape.realize(~shape.circle(5), 0.0, 0.0)))` to discard it
